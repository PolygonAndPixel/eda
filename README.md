# eda
I am testing different kinds of EDA methods for usage in multimodal, non-convex, non-smooth likelihood (or "energy") surfaces.

## Usage
Compile using 'make release' at root. Go to build/apps and execute 'eda' using
one of the following parameters:
 - poly (run PolyChord with every test function)
 - maps (run MAPS with every test function)
 - sample (sample the whole space for every test function)
